                    Four Seasons are there in the mind of Man.<br/>
                    He hath his lusty spring when fancy clear<br/>
                    Takes in all beauty with an easy span:<br/>
                    He hath his Summer, when luxuriously<br/>
                    He chews the honied cud of fair spring thoughts,<br/>
                    Till, in his Soul dissolv'd they come to be<br/>
                    Part of himself. He hath his Autumn ports<br/>
                    And Havens of repose, when his tired wings<br/>
                    Are folded up, and he content to look<br/>
                    On Mists in idleness: to let fair things<br/>
                    Pass by unheeded as a threshhold brook.<br/>
                    He hath his Winter too of pale Misfeature,<br/>
                    Or else he would forget his mortal nature.<br/>
